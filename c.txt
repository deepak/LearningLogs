- reading the "21st Century C" book
- add a zsh function to make and execute c file
  function crun() {
    make $1 CFLAGS='-Wall'
    ./$1
  }
- use pkg-config to search for libs
  pkg-config --list-all
  it includes homebrew installed packages
  eg.
   > pkg-config --libs libpng libxml-2.0
   > -L/usr/local/Cellar/libpng/1.6.17/lib -lpng16 -lxml2
   > pkg-config --cflags libpng libxml-2.0
   > -I/usr/local/Cellar/libpng/1.6.17/include/libpng16 -I/usr/include/libxml2
- use `cpp -v` to search paths and other details
- some useful flags.
  -g: include debug info
  -Wall, -Weverything, -Weverything: warnings
  these warnings are different on gcc and clang.
  also -Wall, -Wextra and -Wpedantic
- Makefile
  target needs to begin with a tab
  eg.
  clean:
	rm -rf $(P) $(P).dSYM

  P=hello
  OBJECTS=
  CFLAGS = -g -Wall -O3
  LDLIBS=
  #CC=c99
  CC=clang

  $(P): $(OBJECTS)

  clean:
	rm -rf $(P) $(P).dSYM

  TODO
  - -o hello.out and add to gitignore
  - c99 does not have -Wall ?
  - syntax to override options
    eg. CFLAGS ="-g -O3" make
    without omitting CFLAGS from the Makefile

  why does the one-liner:

  clean: rm -rf $(P) $(P).dSYM

  not work ?

- how to get docs for stdlib.h and stdio.h
  and see its contents
  pkg-config --libs --cflags stdlib stdio
  does not give anything
- llvm is much more verbose than gdb.
  particularly for printing
  look at some common alias
  search for 'lldbinit' in github
- how to install and use GCC in osx.
  does it cause any issues or conflict with llvm ?
  clang has the '-pg' flag
  but llvm does not have gprof (is gcc)
  please have sugested google-perf-tools for cpu profiling
  any other options on llvm ?
  or can use gprof with llvm on osx ?
  http://www.uio.no/studier/emner/matnat/ifi/INF5063/h13/Resources/inf5063-pno-prof-work.pdf
  talks about
  - llvm-prof
  - cachegrind
  did not find `llvm-prof` on osx ?
